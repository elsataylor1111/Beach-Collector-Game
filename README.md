Beach Collector Game

Welcome to Beach Collector, a fast-paced beach adventure! Dive into a sunny beach setting as the main character. Your mission is to collect beach treasures—like colorful fish and seashells—while dodging dangerous bombs that track your every move. For every beach-related object you collect, you earn points and hear a cheerful success sound. But beware! Hitting a bomb will make you lose one of your three lives, accompanied by a sharp warning sound. Run out of lives, and it’s game over. As you play, the challenge ramps up: more items fly in, and you’ll need quicker reflexes to avoid the bombs. How many treasures can you collect before the beach gets too chaotic?

General Information 

Since Beach Collector is an artistic game, the creative challenge  invites players to engage in an immersive experience as players experience a balance between beauty and chaos as they collect beach items while avoiding bombs. The game symbolizes navigating growing complexities in a relaxing environment, inviting players to adapt, focus, and stay in the flow amid rising challenges. 

The purpose of my game is to create an engaging artistic experience where players have fun playing a beach related game and have to balance enjoyment and focus. 

I chose this as my game because I wanted to capture and share the joy of being at the beach, as being at the beach as many positive memories.
